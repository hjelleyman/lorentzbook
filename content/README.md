# Jupyter books

Over the past couple days I have had a look at this thing called [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/) for displaying the code in a user friendly way. In the short term this takes a little setting up but could be something to look at in the long term.
This is an example of what it could look like with the code I have currently written.

You can combine markdown files and Jupyter notebooks to get nice ``website-like'' pages like this.

In these Jupyter Books, you can choose what code and outputs the reader can see while not allowing them to edit and thus break any code.
This could be potentially useful
