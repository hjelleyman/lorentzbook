<h1 id="Jupyter-books">Jupyter books<a class="anchor-link" href="#Jupyter-books"> </a></h1><p>Over the past couple days I have had a look at this thing called <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/">Jupyter books</a> for displaying the code in a user friendly way. In the short term this takes a little setting up but could be something to look at in the long term.
This is an example of what it could look like with the code I have currently written.</p>
<p>You can combine markdown files and Jupyter notebooks to get nice ``website-like'' pages like this.</p>
<p>In these Jupyter Books, you can choose what code and outputs the reader can see while not allowing them to edit and thus break any code.
This could be potentially useful</p>
